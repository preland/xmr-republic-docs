# 34% Attack

If an attacker is able to amass a 34% "minority" of quorum members, they will be able to temporarily prevent consensus, effectively "halting" the network until the issue is resolved. In the case of a slowly increasing "bad" minority, members of the group can be marked by other nodes in the network as being "bad", and they can be replaced with nodes from the "alternate" pool. As the alternate pool is limited in size (1/6th), there is a limit to how many nodes can be "replaced". When this limit is reached, any further failing nodes, alternative or otherwise, will still be considered full members of the consensus. If the number of "bad" nodes exceeds 50% (1/3 + 1/6), consensus is completely halted, and will not be able to fix itself until the next epoch. While this scenario is not perfect, it is preferable to the equivalent scenario in Nakamura consensus.
