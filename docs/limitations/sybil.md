# Sybil

The main challenge when attempting to move away from Nakamura consensus is the issue of so-called "Sybil" attacks, where an attacker uses multiple identities in order to obtain undue priviledge or advantage. Due to the design of Monero Republic, this is a significant design challenge, with a clear and strong malincentive for participants to run multiple nodes. This is unfortunately an issue that Republic inherits from Qubic, which too suffers from Sybil-related risks. "Naive" attempts to resolve this issue, such as subnet-based filtering, do not fully solve the issue and will usually cause more harm to honest participants than good (for example, any form of naive heuristic filtering will inherently necessitate the removal of nodes that use techniques to anonymize their location, such as a darknet or proxy, regardless of Sybil intentions).

Thankfully, there are some upsides to Republic that make it, in the worst case scenario, only mildly worse than the equivalent PoW scenario. Because participants are ultimately chosen by collective hashrate, any Sybil attack could at most only take down the network for nine days (this is assuming that manual intervention is not made by the remaining honest participants to "override" the attackers and restart the network, which is a potential mitigation strategy) before participants could "vote" them out at the next epoch. Additionally, the hashrate required to perform such an attack would be roughly equivalent to that of a 51% attack in a traditional Nakamura consensus system, while still maintaining higher-level "safeguards" against adverse network behavior.
