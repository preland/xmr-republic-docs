# Executive-Legislative Discrepancy

It should be noted that, similar to real world gubernatorial systems, there is a gap between the "legislative" decisions made through consensus and the "executive" actions taken by those who are tasked with satisfying those decisions. This limits the real-world capability of using the on-chain consensus for larger decisions, as it is entirely possible for an arbitrary consensus to be reached that is incompatible with reality. A severe example of this would be voting to set the value of a universal constant (such as pi) to an arbitrary value (literally impossible to execute, creating a disconnect), with a more mild example being demanding upgrades or fixes that, while technically possible, are outside of the current capability of the development team (functionally impossible to execute, creating a disconnect). Republic is not directly affected by these issues, as the consensus decisions described in this paper are entirely isolated to within the confines of the network itself, but the limits of this consensus design need to be understood to prevent future developers from misconstruing the framework to be a skeleton upon which a distributed autonomous authority, or DAO, can be built: this is not the case, and attempting to do so will cause more harm to Monero than good.
