# Expected Results

Monero, once upgraded to this system, should immediately have a significantly higher transaction throughput than before. In addition, the hashrate will become much more decentralized, reducing the concern for 51% hashrate attacks. Miners will experience the most disruption, but even this large of a change should only have minimal impacts on miner behavior. Thanks to ZK Rollups, wallet syncing for new users becomes trivially fast and efficient, especially for users syncing at or near the beginning of an epoch. Transactions are processed and finalized quickly (less than 15 seconds), enabling the currency to become viable for everyday usage. All of this happens, without compromise to privacy and security. In short, Monero becomes more than a mere "privacy tool" or crypto curiousity---it becomes a genuinely competitive alternative to modern payment processors.
